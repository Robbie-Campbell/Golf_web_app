# Golf_web_app

## A cool project that was made during the lockdown for members of a golf club!

#### Takes an input of four golfers and randomizes them to produce a result!

> This was used as the nromal approach could not be used due to players not being able to touch each others golf balls.

> Functioned well! Not the most aestetically pleaing app but served it's purpose and was made in a short time.
